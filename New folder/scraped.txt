The New York Drama Critics’ Circle has named “Shuffle Along” the best new musical of the season, and “The Humans” the best new play.
The awards are significant because they are chosen by theater critics, but have limited predictive value for the Tony Awards because the critics consider both Broadway and Off Broadway shows each season, so they are often out of sync with the Tonys cycle. The group had named “Hamilton” the best new musical last season, when it played Off Broadway at the Public Theater, making that show ineligible for this year’s award.
“Shuffle Along,” which has the full title of “Shuffle Along, or The Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,” is a jazz-and-tap show that explores the history of an early all-black Broadway musical. It features songs from the 1921 musical by Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and a new book by George C. Wolfe, who also directed the show.
“The Humans,” written by Stephen Karam and directed by Joe Mantello, is about a close-knit family grappling over Thanksgiving dinner with a series of unexpected disappointments and challenges.
“Shuffle Along” has been nominated for a Tony Award for best new musical, but “Hamilton” is widely expected to win that category. “The Humans” has been nominated for a Tony Award for best new play, and is a leading contender in that category.
The Drama Critics’ Circle includes 22 New York-area theater critics. Critics from The New York Times are not part of the organization.
Peace in the Lyon family is always just one exposed secret or conversation away from crumbling. It was no different on this week’s episode, “More Than Kin,” but somehow it managed to hold. As the season winds down (only three more episodes to go), the family inches closer to regaining control of the company. That is, if they can stick together until a board meeting, where it appears that Lucious Lyon will be reinstated as chief executive.
In order to make that happen, amends need to be made. Yet Lucious remains in a cold war of sorts with his sons. He and Jamal are both campaigning to win the same American Sound Award; Andre is still grappling with the revelation of his grandmother’s mental health issues (which Lucious kept a secret); and Hakeem hasn’t exactly forgiven him for short-circuiting his tenure as the head of Empire.
More than that, the family — and those outside of it — continues to come to terms with Empire’s pending heir, Hakeem’s baby with Anika. Hakeem baby proofs his bachelor pad and invites Anika over in an effort to show that he takes the responsibility seriously, telling her that his family’s dysfunction has showed him what not to do. When Hakeem threatens to distance himself and the baby from the family if Lucious doesn’t treat Anika better, Cookie heads over to Anika’s to extend an olive branch. But when she gets there she finds Anika being rushed into an ambulance as a result of what appears to be a panic attack. In an effort to calm her, Cookie says “forget everything” and puts aside her disdain, even if only momentarily, in the interest of her grandchild’s well-being.
In a scene that echoes one from earlier this season, several members of the family rush to the hospital, only this time the news is promising, as Anika and the baby appear to be recovering fine. Like the earlier scene — in which the family gathered after Ronda had a miscarriage (after being pushed by Anika) — Hakeem is initially treated as an outsider, with Anika’s mother berating him for being absent during the pregnancy. Shortly after, the roles reverse and he becomes the gatekeeper when Lucious arrives. After a discussion, Lucious offers to make arrangements for Anika and the baby to get the best medical care.
As the episode concludes, a charity event seems to have persuaded Empire’s board to keep a member of the Lyon family at the helm of the company. But (twist!) instead of reinstating Lucious, they want Cookie and Lucious as co-chief executives. Is there enough room for two to reign over the Empire?
Three Portentous Pieces of Dialogue
“You and me finally working together side by side, I wouldn’t have it any other way.” — Lucious
Lucious loves sharing power as much as a toddler loves sharing their favorite toy. So, when he immediately agrees to become co-chief executive it’s either another plot or the ultimate thank you to Cookie for all she sacrificed for the company. People can change, right? Right?
“That woman’s name is Leah Walker. I believe she’s your grandmother.” — Harper Scott
When Andre learns that his grandmother is still alive, he leaves Empire’s charity event. Lucious has alluded to her committing suicide. Did she really attempt to take her life? And after learning that she was alive, why did he keep her existence a secret while apparently paying to keep her in a group home? Will Leah’s presence help Andre as he copes with his illness or will her return throw the family into another tailspin?
“You worry about that scallop you have coming to see you.” — Cookie
Ever since Lucious began working with Harper, a journalist, Cookie has shown hints of jealousy but denies those feelings to both Lucious and her sons. With Cookie and Lucious now working closer than ever, will they reconcile their romantic relationship?
Cowboys: Don DeLillo’s 16th novel, “Zero K,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 13. In a recent Q. and A. with The Los Angeles Times, DeLillo counted the book among the three most significant of his career. (The others were also best sellers: “Libra” spent five weeks on the list in 1988, and “Underworld” had a 10-week run in 1997-98.) DeLillo is well known for his attention to the music and even the visual appearance of his sentences: “The words typed on the white page have a sculptural quality,” he told The Paris Review in 1993. But to judge from his interview with The Los Angeles Times, this devotion to craft doesn’t extend to shoptalk with writer friends. “When I talk to novelists, we tend to talk about movies,” he said. “It’s true. It’s much easier to talk about. I just don’t talk much about my work with other writers, and I don’t talk much about their work. A few sentences. We’re like two characters in an old western movie in which the main element, the main audio element is to be very laconic. That’s what happens when I talk about writing with other writers.”
Fast Food: Money may not buy love, but it does come in handy for humbler cravings. Pizza, for instance. According to Philip Norman’s biography “Paul McCartney: The Life,” new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list, McCartney once used some of his Beatles fortune to order a particular New York pizza he wanted delivered. To England. On the Concorde. McCartney’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment on how much he tipped the pilot.
Huttslayer: The latest novel from the “Star Wars” universe — Claudia Gray’s “Bloodline,” No. 5 in its first week on the hardcover fiction list — puts Princess Leia front and center, tracking her life in the decades between “Return of the Jedi” and “The Force Awakens.” Among other things, it reveals that Leia is known in some quarters as “The Huttslayer,” revered for killing the enormous sluglike villain Jabba the Hutt. “Think about it,” Gray told Entertainment Weekly. “For a human being to kill a Hutt with her bare hands? That’s unbelievable. Anybody who would be able to pull that off would be remembered for it. That would be legend.”
The President and the King: The former Secret Service agent Clint Hill is best known for his presence at John F. Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas. But Hill remained in the service for years after that, and — as he recounts in “Five Presidents,” written with Lisa McCubbin and new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 9 — he was on hand for another indelible moment, when Elvis Presley offered his services to President Nixon. “He thought he could do a good job helping the United States government deal with the drug problem,” Hill told People magazine. “So he thought it would be a good idea if they would make him a special agent.” Nixon demurred but gave him a souvenir badge. “He went away happy,” Hill said.

Picture a golden domed ring of phyllo pastry filled with creamy cheese, speckled green with sharp spring herbs and dotted pink with bits of brawny prosciutto. Imagine cutting into it, watching the glistening shards of burnished pastry shatter as they meet your knife.
Then contemplate making it.
If your temples start to sweat at the idea of executing such a gilded masterpiece, fear not. Because unlike others of its ilk, this phyllo torte is an absolute cinch to make. It does not require the fussy buttering of each individual phyllo layer. Nor does it matter if any of the gossamer pastry sheets — thin enough to read a recipe through — rip or tear.
In fact, ripping and tearing are part of the process. So is a Bundt pan, which gives the pastry its glorious vaults without any special effort on your part.
Defrost your store-bought phyllo dough, then drape sheets of it over the pan. Use your fingers to make holes to accommodate the pan’s center shaft so you can press the dough to the bottom. Don’t worry if the pastry rumples and snags. Fill the pastry-lined pan with cheese and herbs and cured cubes of meat, then pour on plenty of melted butter.
That’s the key to success: this melted butter bath. As the butter seeps from top to bottom, it infiltrates the phyllo layers as thoroughly as if you had carefully brushed each one. It takes about one minute rather than 20, then bakes up into burnished perfection.
As for the filling, you can use pretty much anything that you think would taste good nestled in crunchy, brittle pastry. In Greece, that often means feta cheese, spinach or braising greens. In Turkey, it can mean meat, vegetables, herbs, cheese or eggs — or some combination of all of the above.
I looked to Italy for inspiration and came up with a base of milky ricotta and eggs into which I mixed pecorino Romano, ricotta salata, mozzarella and prosciutto, adding spring herbs for freshness.
You can skip the meat if you like, or use greens instead of herbs. As long as you keep the ratio of 1½ pounds of ricotta to three eggs, you have room to play with the flavorings.
If you’re planning ahead, you can assemble the entire torte the day before baking, then pop it into the oven a couple of hours before your guests arrive.
Then envision them oohing and aahing as you serve it forth. Because that’s exactly what will happen when this flaky, cheesy fantasy becomes a reality.
Recipe: Phyllo Ricotta Torte With Spring Herbs
Among celebrated spring foods like ramps, nettles, green garlic, asparagus, sorrel and rhubarb, the poor dandelion is too often forgotten.
It’s a pity. Tender dandelion leaves make a sensational salad, while larger leaves are marvelous sautéed, stir-fried, wilted or stewed with garlic and olive oil.
In theory, dandelions should appeal to a wide audience: the health-conscious eater, the forager and even the Francophile (one person could conceivably fit all these definitions). In the past, the dandelion was well known as a folk medicine cure-all. Used in soups or tinctures or made into wine, dandelion was long thought to be a blood cleanser, good for the liver and the kidneys and rejuvenating as a spring tonic.
Modern science shows that the dandelion is generally good for you, as well as high in vitamins A and C. I’m not a nutritionist, but even the briefest research on the topic suggests we should all be eating more of this healthful green. (Maybe it could become the new kale.)
If you love foraging, dandelions are easy prey because they grow wild pretty much everywhere. Pick them before they begin to flower, while the leaves are still relatively tender. And of course, you need to know that they have not been treated with weed killer or other toxic chemicals.
Should you prefer to forage the urban way, fresh-picked dandelion greens of both cultivated and wild varieties are showing up at farmers’ markets now. Supermarkets usually stock a very long-leaved variety; those are fine, but trim them ruthlessly, using just the top eight inches of the leaves for salad. Like some chicories, dandelion has a pleasant slight bitterness, more so with the wild than the cultivated type.
This recipe is modeled after a classic Parisian salad with lardons, beets and eggs, but the garlicky, mustardy vinaigrette has fresh ginger and lime juice, too, to stand up to dandelions’ earthy flavor. It still tastes very French, especially with the goat cheese toasts.
And so much tastier than a green superfood smoothie, n’est-ce pas?
